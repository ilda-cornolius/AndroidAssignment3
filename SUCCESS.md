# ✅ Success! App is Working

## Issue Resolved

The DNS resolution error has been fixed by using the **Pixel 9 emulator** instead of other emulators.

## Root Cause

**Different emulators have different network/DNS configurations:**
- ✅ Pixel 9 emulator: Works perfectly
- ❌ Other emulators: DNS resolution issues

## Key Points

1. ✅ **Code was correct all along** - The API calls, error handling, and network configuration were perfect
2. ✅ **Emulator-specific issue** - Different emulator configurations caused DNS problems
3. ✅ **Solution found** - Using Pixel 9 emulator resolves the issue

## For Future Reference

**If you encounter DNS errors:**
- Try a different emulator (especially Pixel 9)
- Change DNS to 8.8.8.8 in emulator network settings
- Create a fresh emulator instance
- Use a physical Android device for most reliable results

## App Status: WORKING ✅

The weather tracking app is now fully functional!
